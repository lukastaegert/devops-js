# Own your Build Stepâ€”Own your Code

Slides for my [Devops.js talk on March 29-30, 2021](https://www.devopsjsconf.com/).

Watch them online at [lukastaegert.github.io/devops-js](https://lukastaegert.github.io/devops-js).

To run them locally

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The terminal server for the first demo requires a `bash` command to be available, as well as docker for the actual demo.
